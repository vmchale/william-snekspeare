# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# A snapshot resolver dictates the compiler version and the set of packages
# to be used for project dependencies. For example:
#
# resolver: lts-3.5
# resolver: nightly-2015-09-21
# resolver: ghc-7.10.2
# resolver: ghcjs-0.1.0_ghc-7.10.2
# resolver:
#  name: custom-snapshot
#  location: "./custom-snapshot.yaml"
compiler: ghc-8.0.2
compiler-check: match-exact
resolver: lts-7.15

# will not be run. This is useful for tweaking upstream packages.
